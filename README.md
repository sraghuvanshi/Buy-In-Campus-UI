# Buy In Campus 

BuyInCampus is an online platform exclusively for college students that provides you a dedicated marketplace at your own college/school campus for selling the stuff like  books, notes, electronics,  furnitures, fashion items, calculators, drafters, lab coats, lab manuals, old phone/laptop, electric kettle, bike/scooty/cycle, college projects etc. that are no longer fascinating to you but might be a requirement for someone else within your college campus at reasonable price. Also, one can even find an accordant roommate & live the life of Riley. Not only that, but one can also get Campus News & Updates like events, fests & workshops. Students can promote their society events/workshops, find people who share their interests and make new friends while doing all of the above.
